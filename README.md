# blackcoffer_test_assignment
This repo contains the solution of the test assignment on NLP based problem for Blackcofffer.

##However I recommend you to not waste time on Blackcoffer as they are doing scams on Internshala, I have applied for the Data Science/ Machine learning Job/Internship at Blackcoffer on Internshala, and they ask you to complete the assignment first for the next steps, I have completed and submitted that assignment several times, wasted my precious time on their assignments, and they never reply. Instead of taking my application to the next steps, they publish a new job for the same role, with the same assignment for the next week, I've tried messaging Ajay on Linkedin, who is the CEO of Blackcoffer, apparently, he has a lot of time on LinkedIn to post and comment on a lot of posts but never replied back, also reached him on skype but never heard back, Mailed Internshala for this, they also did not reply. 

## If you are seriously looking for a job or internship, I would recommend you not waste your time on the Blackcoffer assignment, apparently, they are doing some kind of marketing on people who are looking for jobs, they don't care about your situation at all.

Meanwhile, if you are trying to solve the problem that they provided you can look in the main.py file, which will first read the URL's from Input.xlsx and visit each URL and scrap data from that page, later that data will be saved inside the text_files folder for each URL with the text file name as index value form Input.xlsx file.
Later Stop words, negative words, and positive words are loaded inside a variable, and for each text file, data will be read and the output variables will be created.
An output.csv file will be created after iterating through all the text files. Logs will be also generated and saved, you can go ahead and play with the code and you can also implement the asyncin this assignment
